        Hello! My name is Savanna Lever. I'm originally from Columbia, South Carolina.
         I'm an only child, except for two little dogs. 
         I moved here to Orlando last April to work at Disney but quit soon after, and now I work at a coffee shop called Fuel! 
         Hopefully when I'm finished with this program I can do freelance web design or even completely switch
        careers. Haven't really decided on that yet. Some things I enjoy are baking bread, roasting coffee, and sewing!
